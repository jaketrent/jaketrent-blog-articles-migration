When your app requires users to be using the `https` protocol to make requests and get responses, it's helpful to have an automatic redirect so the user is always in the right place.  Here's how to do that for a Node Express app on Heroku.

## Secure Express Requests

The [Express](http://expressjs.com) request object has a bunch of great information.  One of its attributes is `secure`.  It's a boolean.  Usually, `secure == true` will mean that you're on `https`.  When that is not true, you're ready for a redirect.  

Unfortunately for apps hosted on Heroku, `request.secure` will always be false.  The way that Heroku routing works, it will just never be set.  

## Heroku Https Header

Instead, Heroku forwards an http header that allows us to do the same "is secure" test.  On Heroku, `request.header('x-forwarded-proto')` will contain the actual protocol string (eg, 'http' or 'https').

## Express Middleware SSL Redirect 

If you're using the Express framework on Node, then you have it easy.  There's already a great middleware mechanism for you to send any or all requests through.  If you set your Express app (v3) up like this:

```coffeescript
app = express()
```

Then you can use the `app.use` functionality to specify a middleware.  Since I only have certificates and want the redirect to happen in the production environment, I will likewise wrap this middleware inside `app.configure` for prod (it inspects `NODE_ENV` for you).  This redirect will be pretty rudimentary, but it's just that simple, so here it goes:

```coffeescript
app.configure 'production', ->
  app.use forceSsl(req, res, next) ->
    if req.header 'x-forwarded-proto' != 'https'
      res.redirect "https://#{req.header 'host'}#{req.url}"
    else
      next()
```

If it's not `https` already, redirect the same url on `https`.  If it is, that's what I want, and you can pass on through my middleware function.  Note that this middleware will protect *all* urls on the site with an `https` redirect.  Your middleware could be more selective.  You could even create this as a stacked middleware per route if you wanted.  We could even enhance our middleware to use inspect both the http header *and* the `secure` flag.

Heroku threw us a for a minor, unexpected loop, but it was nothing that we couldn't easily code for.
