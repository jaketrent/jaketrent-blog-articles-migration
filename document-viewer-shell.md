For me, one of the major draws for Linux is the oh-so-awesome bash shell.  I also like the default pdf viewer for Ubuntu.  I always forget that this thing is called evince.

For me, one of the major draws for Linux is the oh-so-awesome bash shell.  I also like the default pdf viewer for Ubuntu.  I always forget that this thing is called <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/evince/">evince</a>.  It's a gnome project and is very nice.  Xpdf is also nice, but not preinstalled, but still pretty fast.  

Evince supports viewing these file formats:
- PDF
- Postscript
- djvu
- tiff
- dvi

To open your doc, type this in the shell of awesomeness:
```bash
evince document.pdf &
```
