MountainWest JavaScript was a great conference last week.  It was a jubilee. Well, if you can have a jubilee in the first year of a conference.   Here's my take.

## Format

[MountainWest JavaScript](http://mtnwestjs.org/) started this year as a part of the larger Mountain West conference set, including [devops](http://mtnwestdevops.org/) and [Ruby](http://mtnwestrubyconf.org/) as well.  It was two full days.  There is a single track -- everyone (that stays) hears everything.  Love both these features.  Splitting the disciplines into separate conferences is genius.

## Speakers

The speaker lineup was exceptional.  There were many great minds assembled, fun experience shared, and great companies represented.  Following [ng-conf](/post/ng-conf-review/) earlier this year, I was again pleasantly surprised at the amount of great content.  I did not attend the devops or ruby portions, but it has been said by some that they were not as exceptional.

Thanks to the organizers for selecting great content and presenters.  Thank you to all the speakers for preparing some killer talks.

## Topics

The mix of topics seemed relevant and varied.  This was welcome.  There was just a bit of overlap on some topics.  Conference organizers put similar topics together, which was fine.  But in one case, the back-to-back speakers, from the same company and essentially the same topic had so much overlap that it was obvious.  Repetition is good, but it should be done in front of the YouTube recording of a single, great talk on the subject.  The conference was recorded, so hopefully we can see the sessions online soon.

## Venue

The conference met at the Salt Lake City Public Library.  It's a great city.  It's a cool building.  It has a location close to public transit lines.  The stadium seating in the conference room is good for visibility but bad for knees.  There were plenty of power sources.

Despite these good points about the location, I found myself not super-excited about showing up at the library for another conference.  I feel like it's time for something fresh.

## Swag

There was a nice shirt with mysterious symbols emblazened across the front.  Ruby was discernable.  I'm still up in the air over which represents JavaScript or devops.  There was also a nice, laminate sticker that they gave out with the conference logo.  Sponsors gave out nothing.  I was hoping for an O.C. Tanner gold bracelet and Instructure panda hoodie.  There was also a stunning lack of sweet treats and lunch. :(  In the place of actual food, there was an especially long, 2-hour lunch break -- oh, and a lot of water.

## I'd Go Again

I'd definitely go again if the speaker and topic lineup seemed as promising as it turned out to be this year.  Next year, hopefully I'll attend at a different location in Salt Lake City and enjoy a chocolate eclair whilst learning about how I can actually use es6 features in the then-current evergreen browsers.

## My Notes
