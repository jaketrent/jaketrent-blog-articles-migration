## The Gist

Overall, the book was not what I expected.  Jon Acuff, in his book, Quitter, describes his past self as a serial quitter.  Thus, he has plenty of quitting experience to speak from.  He essentially says that he did it the wrong way.  Then, he tries to share some tips on how to quit the right way.  Essentially, his point is to keep your day job, and use it to prepare patiently for making your dream job a reality.

## Great Points

Given that his book is based on his real life experiences, it should be no surprise that he brought up some insightful points.  Here are some I found most enlightening:

#### The Value of Invisilibity

Invisibility has value.  When we haven't set ourselves up as the biggest professional around, we have a shorter distance to fall.  We all still fail at times, so the combo is a plus.  You can dream big in this mode because when you fail big, no one cares.  And you can do this over and over again.

The safest or most conservative person in the world will be the person with the most visibility.  Why?  Because they have a reputation and a performance record to keep up.  If you don't have to maintain that, you'll probably take interesting risks more readily.  When we see people at the height of their success, we don't have visibility into the long years that came before when they were building it.

#### Quantity is Essential in Starting a Dream

We need to practice our dream.  We can see ourself successful in our minds, but interesting work requires serious skill.  Moreover, going straight to the pinnacle of our eventual quality standard will paralyze us in the short term.  We will find ourselves unable to produce.  In Jon Acuff's case, he realized that he gave away 1 million blog words before he was ever good enough or had a following enough to publish and sell 50 thousand words.

#### Perils of Business Ownership

Being an entreprenuer is a special job.  But, that life is not for the faint of heart.  It's great.  If you're sitting in a day job you don't particularly like, you're probably fantasizing about the potential of ultimate freedom entreprenuership might bring.  It does, and it doesn't.  The beast must be tamed.  Jon takes plenty of time to mention the pitfalls to avoid and the preparations to make in his book.  For instance, he explains what he and close associates have experienced:  That bills will become your new boss.  Your ability to create revenue on your own -- every day! -- will become the new stress.  That is, unless you're able to prepare adequately and time your jump well.

## Jon's Style

I was unprepared for how much I would laugh while reading Jon's book.  Business self-help books are not expected to be very comical or entertaining.  Jon gave the book a fun voice.  It was easy to read out loud to my wife -- you know, for getting on the same dream page.  Jon doesn't take himself to seriously, and that's refreshing.

It's a short read.  It's a fun read.  The information is from the heart, and I think it's worth learning from Jon's experience.  If you're considering ever starting your own business or if you're not in your dream job yet and want to get there, I recommend this book on the subject.
