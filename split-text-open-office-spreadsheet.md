Sometimes I paste text into a spreadsheet so that I can quickly manipulate it.  The same could be done with a small script, but this particular feature is built into Open Office Spreadsheet: You can split text into separate columns using delimiters.

If I had text like this:

    1. The Morning Breaks
    2. The Spirit of God
    3. Now Let Us Rejoice
    4. Truth Eternal
    5. High On A Mountain Top

I would paste it into one column in the spreadsheet, select that column, and select Date -> Text to Columns...  In that dialog, you can select what you want to use as your delimiter.  I my case, I chose the period (".").  That way, the hymn # ends up in column 1, the hymn title in column 2.  The same feature is available in MS Excel.
