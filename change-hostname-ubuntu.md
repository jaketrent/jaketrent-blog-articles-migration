When you setup your computer at the time of your initial Ubuntu installation, you assign your computer a hostname.  In my case, I gave it a hostname and then later wanted to change it to something else.  This is accomplished in two easy steps.

First, 

```bash
sudo emacs /etc/hostname
```

, and overwrite the hostname with the new hostname.  This will make it so the correct name is show when running the hostname command. Second, 

```bash
sudo emacs /etc/hosts
```

, and overwrite the hostname here.  This will allow you to use sudo successfully and network applications to run.  This was done on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic).
