Unit testing is a required part of a healthy software development lifecycle.  Business logic in MarkLogic Xquery needs the same insurance of superb testing as any other language.  

Principles: Come learn the motivation for unit testing and how test-driven development can increase your productivity writing solid Xquery code in an Agile-coding environment.  

Skills: We'll code Xquery examples to learn general skills including the TDD workflow, how to isolate your code for unit testability, and how to test one thing at a time.  In each case, we'll address how to apply these skills specifically to development in the MarkLogic environment.

Tools: We'll also introduce you to in-house-developed tooling for creating unit tests and running them.  This tooling provides an all-Xquery method of creating test functions, annotating them as such so they're runnable in the test runner, isolating certain modules to test, and viewing clear test results.

With a few principles, skills, and tools for unit testing, you can go forward with increased confidence that the Xquery code you write on MarkLogic is more awesome than ever.
